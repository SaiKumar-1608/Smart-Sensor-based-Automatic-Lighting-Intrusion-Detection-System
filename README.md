# Smart Sensor-Based Automatic Lighting & Intrusion Detection System

An embedded C project built for the **STM32F4** microcontroller, using three types of sensors to detect environmental changes and provide visual feedback via LEDs.

---

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how embedded systems can integrate multiple sensors to build an automated environment-aware system. It activates upon a push button interrupt and performs continuous monitoring of:

- **Motion** via a PIR sensor
- **Distance** using an Ultrasonic sensor
- **Light level** through an LDR and ADC

Each sensor is mapped to a specific LED output, offering intuitive feedback for real-time detection.

##  Features

- **Start Trigger via Button (PA0)**
- **Motion Detection via PIR Sensor (PA3)**
- **Object Detection via Ultrasonic Sensor (Trigger: PA4, Echo: PA5)**
- **Light Intensity Detection via LDR (Analog Input: PA1)**
- **Visual Indication via LEDs**  
  - PIR ‚Üí PA2  
  - Ultrasonic ‚Üí PA7  
  - LDR ‚Üí PA10

| PIR Sensor         | PA3      |
| Ultrasonic Trigger | PA4      |
| Ultrasonic Echo    | PA5      |
| LDR Analog Input   | PA1      |
| LED for PIR        | PA2      |
| LED for Ultrasonic | PA7      |
| LED for LDR        | PA10     |

##  How It Works

1. The system remains in idle state until the **Push Button** (PA0) is pressed (via EXTI0 interrupt).
2. After activation:
   - **PIR Sensor (PA3)**  
     If motion is detected, the LED on **PA2** turns **ON**.
   - **Ultrasonic Sensor (PA4 & PA5)**  
     Sends a 10Œºs trigger pulse on **PA4** and listens for echo on **PA5**. If echo is detected, LED on **PA7** turns **ON**.
   - **LDR Sensor (PA1 - ADC)**  
     Uses ADC to measure light intensity. If the value is **below 1024** (i.e., it's dark), the LED on **PA10** turns **ON**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Interrupt Configuration

- **EXTI Line 0** (connected to PA0) is configured to trigger on **falling edge**.
- Enables system start through external interrupt handler.
